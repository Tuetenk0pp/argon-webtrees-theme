# Argon Theme for webtrees

A theme for the [webtrees](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) online geneology application based on the [Argon Design System](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/argon-design-system). Since webtrees is templated with Bootstrap, this theme applies Argon styles in the majority of places but adapts where necessary.
